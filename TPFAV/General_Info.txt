# FAQs

This section covers a variety of frequently asked questions about the program, the application process, and life in Japan during the program. It's an excellent place to start if you're new to TPFAV.
Q	A
When is the deadline for the application form?	Applications submitted by 17:00 Japan Standard Time on July 31, 2025, will be considered valid.
How can I apply for this program?	Please contact your country's veterinary association to obtain a recommendation. JVMA has already provided information about the application form link to veterinary associations in each country. All applications are accepted online.
Can I bring my family to participate in the program if I cover the expenses myself?	No. The Training Program for Asian Veterinarians 2026 does not permit participants to be accompanied by their family members.
What are the obligations for participating in TPFAV2026?	Participants in the training are required to adhere to the following:
- Do not leave Japan during the training period.
- Dedicate themselves to the training during the training period.
- Submit at least one report to a journal during the training period.
I cannot submit some of the required documents (passport/ academic transcripts/ medical certificate) by the deadline. What should I do?	Please contact us at secretariat.jvma@gmail.com.
How proficient in English do I need to be?	English is the official language of TPFAV. At the very least, you need to have enough English proficiency to communicate orally about the training. Specifically, you need to be able to understand explanations from instructors, be familiar with veterinary medical terminology in your specialty, and express your own ideas.
Can I drive a car in Japan?	Participants in this program are required NOT to drive a car, even if they hold an international driving license.
Can I choose the university where I will be trained?	While you can state your preferred training site during the interview, the final decision is not yours to make. The accepting university will make its decision based on your preferences and your application documents. If you are dissatisfied with the university you are assigned to, you may decline to participate in the program within one week of receiving the results.
Can I earn a degree by participating in this program?	No. This program is not intended for the acquisition of degrees. Only a completion certificate issued by JVMA will be provided.
What expenses should I expect to cover myself when participating in this program?	The expenses for preparing the application documents (obtaining certificates) and participating in the interview will be borne by the applicant. After selection, you will need to cover the cost related to visa applications. Participants are also required to bring their own laptop. For items supported by JVMA, please refer to the Financial Support section.
I want to undertake clinical training for companion animals. Can I study this in the program?	No. This program primarily aims at controlling infectious diseases in livestock, and it is not intended for those who want to study the treatment of companion animals. Please look for another program.
What documents are required for the application?	Please prepare a recommendation letter, graduation certificate of veterinary school, academic transcript, copy of passport, and health certificate. Scan these documents and upload them via the application form. In addition to the documents, you are also required to upload a self-introduction video of no more than three minutes.
Who should write the recommendation letter?	It would be desirable to obtain a recommendation from your workplace supervisor, a professor from your alma mater (veterinary school), or an officer from the veterinary association to which you belong.
What universities are participating in this program?	Thirteen universities are participating in the 2026 program: Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Rakuno Gakuen University, Kitasato University, Iwate University, University of Tokyo, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Azabu University, Nihon University, Osaka Metropolitan University, Yamaguchi University, University of Miyazaki, and Kagoshima University.

I am currently in my final year of university. Can I apply if I don't have work experience?	While it is desirable to have at least one year of work experience, you can still apply. However, please be aware that even if you are selected for the program, your acceptance may be revoked if you fail to graduate from university or fail the veterinary licensing examination.
I can't speak Japanese at all. Is this a problem?	Not at all. The official language of the Training Program for Asian Veterinarians (TPFAV) is English. However, we believe that having a basic level of Japanese will make your life in Japan more comfortable. For this reason, we provide Japanese 101 lessons to accepted participants right after they arrive in Japan. It's okay to start studying Japanese after you have been accepted.
Can I participate in the TPFAV even if I have a chronic illness?	Even if you have health issues, you can apply if a doctor certifies that they will not be a problem for your one-year training life in Japan. The JVMA pays for participants' health insurance premiums, so you can receive medical services if you get injured or sick during your stay in Japan. However, you will have to partially bear the cost of treatment for chronic diseases.
Are there any disqualifications?	If you are in a state not covered by health insurance (for example, pregnancy) or if you have serious health problems that would prevent you from completing the one-year training, your participation will be declined. Also, if you have a criminal history or have been deported from Japan in the past, you will not be able to obtain a residence status, and you will be automatically disqualified.
Can you tell me about the selection process? When will I know if I am accepted or not?	Interviews are conducted in person or online in September and October, 2025. In December, the accepting universities and JVMA hold a meeting to select 14 participants. The notification of acceptance or rejection to applicants will be done no later than December 15, 2025.
Can you tell me the period of TPFAV 2026?	The program runs from April 1, 2026, to March 25, 2027. Depending on flight schedules, the start and end dates may slightly vary.
Specifically, what species of animals can I learn about?	The main species treated by veterinarians in Japan are cattle, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, cats, and chickens. Water buffalos, ducks, and donkeys, which are common in Asia, are not so common in Japan, and therefore they are not the subject of the TPFAV.
